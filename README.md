finance bank Loan Data Analytics Project



This project aims to provide a comprehensive view of a bank's loan performance using data analytics and visualizations. By leveraging Power BI, we monitor key metrics to understand trends, assess loan health, and support strategic decision-making.

Problem Statement

In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we created a grid view report categorized by Loan Status. The primary objective is to:

- Track and analyze loan performance using KPIs.
- Identify areas of risk and opportunity in the lending process.
- Enable data-driven decision-making for improving loan policies and operations.

Key Metrics & KPIs

The dashboard focuses on the following performance indicators:

1. *Total Loan Applications*  
   - Overall applications and Month-to-Date (MTD) trends.
2. *Total Funded Amount*  
   - Total disbursed loans with MTD and MoM (Month-over-Month) changes.
3. *Total Amount Received*  
   - Repayments received from borrowers with MTD & MoM analysis.
4. *Average Interest Rate*  
   - MoM variation in loan interest costs.
5. *Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)*  
   - Measures borrower financial health.

 Loan Status Breakdown

The dashboard also classifies loans into:

- *Good Loans*  
  - Applications %, Count, Funded Amount, Received Amount.
  
- *Bad Loans*  
  - Applications %, Count, Funded Amount, Received Amount.

 Charts & Visual Analysis

The report includes the following analytical visualizations:

1. *Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart)*  
   - Identifies seasonal and monthly lending patterns.

2. *Regional Analysis by State*  
   - Highlights geographic lending activity and disparities.

3. *Loan Term Analysis*  
   - Distribution of loans based on term lengths.

4. *Employee Length Analysis*  
   - Correlation between borrower job stability and loan status.

   - Visualization of loan reasons (education, home improvement, etc.).

6. *Home Ownership Analysis*  
   - Impact of home ownership status on loan application and disbursement.
